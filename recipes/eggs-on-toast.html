<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There is nothing more iconic (and simple!) to make for breakfast than eggs on toast. This nutrient dense meal can be made in less than 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 Eggs</li>
  <li>1 tbsp salted butter</li>
  <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 slice of bread</li>
  <li>Ground pepper</li>
  <li>Garlic powder</li>
  <li>Ground turmeric</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put a small, nonstick pan on medium heat</li>
  <li>Melt the butter and a small drizzle of olive oil together in the pan</li>
  <li>Crack the eggs gently into the pan, taking care to not break the yolks</li>
  <li>Add your sprinkling of pepper, garlic, and turmeric to your taste</li>
  <li>Once the bottom of the eggs whites have completely set (opaque and not see through), gently flip the eggs with a spatula, taking care again to not break the yolks</li>
  <li>Allow the yolk side to cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, to desired yolk consistency(I prefer mine slightly set on the outside but runny on the inside)</li>
  <li>Remove the cooked eggs from the pan an onto a plate to rest</li>
  <li>Add your bread to the still hot pan, allowing it to soak up the remaining oil and butter</li>
  <li>Once the now buttered bread is crispy and toasted on both sides, plate your eggs on to the toast and enjoy!</li>    
</ol>
