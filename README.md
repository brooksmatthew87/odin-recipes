This is my "Odin Project" assignment to make a recipe website

After completing this project, I learned a bit about html and had a few issues I needed to resolve.

Creating links came easier than I expected, and I was even able to link one recipe to a previous recipe because I was using the previous recipe as an ingredient in the new recipe.

I had an issue with images not showing on Github pages, and had to learn to correctly link my images using proper file pathing. (/example compared to ./example or ../example)

I had issues with image sizing being inconsistent and learned to utilize auto height while using a specified width to get them to properly display.

Overall, I feel that I made commits somewhat competently, and ended up using more commits than I expected at first.
